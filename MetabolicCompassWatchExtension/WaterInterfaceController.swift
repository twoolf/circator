// to do for all four:
//   (1): make sure that picker units are being brought over correctly to HK
//          initial tests suggest that picker units differ from hours/minutes
//   (2): add ability to adjust time (not only from time of entry)?
//          e.g. right now sleep is entered as a duration (but from when to when?)
//   (3): add ability to choose exercise type
//          would be a 2nd picker menu
//   (4): add glance screen with summary stats in each of the four categories
//         note: from API call to backend, rather than to phone
//           exercise, water, meals, sleep
//              meals with time-fasting? with time-eating? with time since last meal?
//   (5): add complication(s) -- time in fasting, water, exercise amount --
//         note: should be via API call to backend, rather than to phone
//   (6): add notifications -- based on lack of entry for the day -- (maybe aperiodic) --
//   questions: should users be encouraged to estimate calories burned on exercise?
//              should heart-rate be displayed?
//              should a count-up timer be enabled for meals/exercise?
//              should notifications be enabled to support missing data entry?
//                e.g. could send a notification if missing a day (for now)
//                 -- what about duplicate entries or those that are non-sensical
//              should accelerometer be used for anything?  {probably not}
//              should core-location be used for anything?  {probably not}
//              should there be a 'snack' category for the meals? (4th)
//  for sleep, should it be a prior, e.g. select start time and then interval
//     or first enter interval (duration) and then start or end time?
//  current thought is that all timed events (ie non-water) are entered via an
//    initial screen w/two buttons (one: takes to a duration screen when pushed)
//      other (2nd) is after scrolling to start time, for entering start and then
//      after that the 2nd screen is for end time
//         ((will want to note which screen they entered timed event from))
//  style notes: (a) make font on start/end time circle be larger;
//               (b) re-do colors on circles;
// should water have more than 4-cups at a time and/or should it be timed?
//  glances: right now goal is to have the same seven attributes as the
//      app selected w/their current values; user scrolls through them;
//  complications: will show (max fasting) in small and
//      max-fasting, last-meal-time, and time-spent-eating in longer window
//  should the App also have pages beyond data entry? (e.g. also the 7-metrics?)
// time-travel (1) in modular large support could be to list most recent entry into HealthKit; (2) while in smaller modular/others, could be 'maximum fasting time'; (3) may also want to have option in larger modular for three rows of information, similar to the 5-7 rows in the iPhone App
